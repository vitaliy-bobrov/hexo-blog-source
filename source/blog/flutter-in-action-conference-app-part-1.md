Flutter is a really promising framework for building fully native iOS and Android apps. In this series of posts I will go throught building [Mobile Era](https://mobileera.rocks/) conference application clone. I think the best way to learn any technology is to build real project with it.

First thing I want to admit, my experience based mostly in Front-end area. I've never created any native app in Java o Swift. The experience I have with mobile is PWA (Progressive Web Apps) and Ionic. So if in your opinion I'll do something inefficient or wrong structured, feel free to write it in the comments below or [Tweet me](https://twitter.com/bobrov1989). I'm open to suggestions and improvements ðŸ¤—.

All examples in this post build using `Dart` *2.1* and `Flutter` *v0.10.2*.{post__series}
